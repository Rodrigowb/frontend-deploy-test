# Deployed project


# About the project

This project is a simple one page personal website, to show my specialities on the tech field and the technologies that I know. 

FIrst I ideate the design in Figma and buit a high fidelity prototype for mobile use. Than I developed the website using ReactJs.

# Improvements idea

Create a REST API for backend with the spercialities and technologies to be used for the frontend. This will make the code less verbous and more scalable, because the frontend will iterate throught the API to buid the components.

# Technologies used

1. React
2. Node.js
3. Figma
4. Command Line
5. Git
